## Basic Information

For authentication, **.rhosts** files along with **/etc/hosts.equiv** were utilized by **Rsh**. Authentication was dependent on IP addresses and the Domain Name System (DNS). The ease of spoofing IP addresses, notably on the local network, was a significant vulnerability.

Moreover, it was common for the **.rhosts** files to be placed within the home directories of users, which were often located on Network File System (NFS) volumes.

**Default port**: 514

## Login

```
rsh <IP> <Command>
rsh <IP> -l domain\user <Command>
rsh domain/user@<IP> <Command>
rsh domain\\user@<IP> <Command>
```
